### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### My name is Vitaliy Ustimenko :raising_hand: 

I work with technologies such as Python, SQL, Tableau and Power BI. I use Python for data manipulation and modeling and SQL for extracting information from databases. Tableau helps me visualize data and create interactive reports and dashboards. I am also interested in learning new technologies and methods to improve data analysis and help organizations make decisions.
